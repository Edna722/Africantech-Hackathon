# Africantech-Hackathon

* Welcome to the repository for my Diabetes Prediction project developed during the AfricanTech Hackathon! This project is designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various medical data inputs using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
* The purpose of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether an individual is at risk of developing diabetes.
* By using historical medical data, this model can provide early warnings for high-risk individuals, helping healthcare professionals implement preventive measures.

The project was built in a single sprint as part of the AfricanTech Hackathon, where I leveraged machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and make predictions.

## Key Features
* Dataset: I utilized a publicly available diabetes dataset containing features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, insulin levels, and glucose measurements.
* Model: The core of the project uses various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines) to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on the input data.
* Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization techniques were applied to ensure the dataset was ready for modeling.
* Evaluation: The model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure its effectiveness and reliability.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas (for data manipulation)
* Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
* Jupyter Notebook (for development)
